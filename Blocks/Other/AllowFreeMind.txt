Let you mind drift now for a moment, just relaxing. Not needing to focus, or think...just drifting, as the tension drains away and your body relaxes.
Simply rest, enjoying this relaxation. no need to focus on anything, let your mind think whatever it wants... Floating...relaxing. It's okay to just relax now...
Right now, you don't need to do anything at all...you don't need to focus on anything. Just allow your mind to be free. Think about whatever you want, appreciate what you have... let your mind enjoy it's freedom
Now you can stop, there's no need to do anything at all, simply relax for a few moments... Just be.
Now you can simply relax...no need to focus on anything at all. Just drift... relaxing...
Now simply relax, calmly, enjoying the feeling of relaxation for a few moments without focusing on anything... let your mind free...
Simply rest...relax... this is a moment where you can let your mind be as crazy as it wants, let your mind free for a few moments
In this moment you will let your mind free... there is nothing you need to be doing in this moment, besides accepting this moment just as it is.
You can enjoy time of doing nothing, and feel good about taking a few moments to do nothing at all. Just let your mind free
