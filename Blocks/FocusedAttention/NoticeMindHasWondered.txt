When your attention wanders, as it will, just focus back again on your breathing.
Notice any stray thoughts, but don’t dwell on them. Simply let the thoughts pass.
As thoughts intrude, allow them to pass, and return your attention to your breathing.
As your attention drifts, focus again on your breathing.....
Don't worry if your attention wanders, just return your focus to your breathing.
Every so often, your mind will wonder... that's normal, just calmly bring your focus back to the breath
When your thoughts drift, focus your attention again on your breath.
As thoughts enter your mind, as they will, just turn your attention back to your breath.
If your mind drifts, allow each thought to pass, without dwelling on any particular thoughts. Let each thought come and go, and notice each thought as an observer.
I want you to allow all thoughts to pass, and simply relax. Do nothing. There is nothing you need to do or to think about. Every time thoughts arise, just let the thoughts go, emptying your mind completely.
It is normal to have many different thoughts going through your mind throughout the process of meditation – that’s okay! Just acknowledge the thoughts and bring your attention back to the breath. It doesn’t mean you are doing anything wrong.
When thoughts come to mind, disregard them and turn your attention back to your body.
As thoughts arise, acknowledge them and let them go, returning your attention to your breathing....
As your thoughts wander, simply return your attention to your breathing.
Acknowledge your thoughts and focus again on your breathing..... Interruptions are normal....just let these thoughts go and return your attention to your breathing....

Allow distracting thoughts to float by.... not focusing on them
