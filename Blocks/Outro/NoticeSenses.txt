Now that you are finishing this relaxation exercise... Turn your attention to the environment outside of yourself... what do you hear around you?... what do you taste?... what can you touch?
Notice the environment around you... the temperature.... sounds..... smells....
Now that we're finishing your meditation practice... begin noticing the world around you... notice the temperature... what do you hear?... do you taste anything in your mouth?...
Now it is time to gently reawaken your body and mind. Keeping your eyes closed, notice the sounds around you. Feel the floor beneath you. Feel your clothes against your body.
Gradually re-awaken your mind and body by turning your attention from inward to outward.... just scanning your body and noticing how your body feels... the temperature.... sounds..... smells.... start becoming aware of the room you are in.
When you are ready to return to your waking level of consciousness, slowly leave this relaxed state you are in. Keep with you a feeling of calm, while becoming more awake and alert.
Turn your attention to your surroundings. Notice the sounds around you as you become more aware and alert.
Now it is time to start to become aware of your surroundings and return to your usual level of alertness. Keep your eyes closed for a few moments while your body reawakens.
For now, itâ€™s time to return to the day head. Slowly reawaken your mind and body, becoming alert and awake while remaining relaxed and calm.
Now that you have completed this meditation exercise, give yourself a few moments to reawaken and get reoriented to your surroundings.
Keep with you this feeling of relaxation now as you reawaken your body to return to the day ahead.
Now slowly begin to reawaken....and turn your attention to your breathing. Notice your calm, smooth breaths...in and out...
