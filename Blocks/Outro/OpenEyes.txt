Now, open your eyes and turn your attention to your surroundings.
Open your eyes and sit quietly for a few moments, becoming more aware of your surroundings.
Slowly... open your eyes... notice the colors around you.....
Open your eyes, and remain sitting for a few moments longer.
Open your eyes and look around the room, becoming re-oriented to your surroundings.
Open your eyes and sit quietly for a moment while you reorient to your surroundings...
Open your eyes, and look around. Check your surroundings... the world around you...
Open your eyes and look around, returning to full alertness.
Sit for a moment now with your eyes open, observing the room around you. When you are ready, return to your usual activities, keeping with you a sense of calm and relief.
Sit quietly for a few moments with your eyes open, reorienting yourself to your surroundings. When you are fully awake and alert, you can return to the hours ahead, feeling confident and content.
Sit quietly for a moment with your eyes open... enjoying the feeling of relaxation while gradually re-awakening... adjust your position slightly....
