Now as you inhale, count silently... one.... As you exhale, count...two... Wait for the next breath, and count again... three. Exhale...four, inhale...five, exhale...six. Continue to count each inhalation and exhalation
Now as you relax... you can count your breaths as they continue to flow gently. Count 10 breaths.
Concentrate on your breathing. Count to see how long each breath takes. When you begin to breathe in, start counting silently in your mind, â€œone... two... three..." Continue to count as you inhale and exhale this breath, stopping when you finish the breath out. Then start again at one, and count from the start of the next breath in, to the end of the breath out. Keep counting like this, noticing how long each breath is.
Breathe slowly, deeply.... in..... and out..... in.... out.... As you continue to breathe, count each breath out. In.... one.....Out... two....In..... three.... Out.... four .....In..... five....out.... six.....Keep counting on your own now.... focusing all your attention on your breathing.... and on the numbers..... If you lose count, simply start again at one.
Keep breathing slowly... You can slow your breathing even further by counting. Let's breathe counting to four. Breathe in...2...3...4...hold...2...3...4.... exhale...2...3...4... Breathe in...hold...breathe out... Breathe in...and out... Keep breathing...letting your breath slow comfortably.
Focus on your breathing ...noticing...relaxing. Count each inhale and exhale.... inhale.... 1, exhale... 2, inhale.... 3, exhale.... 4
Let's use mental focus to help you relax. All you need to do is count up from one to five, then back down to one. I'll count with you for a while, and then you can count on your own. Try to count in time with your breathing, inhale.... 1, exhale... 2, inhale.... 3, exhale.... 4, inhale.... 5, exhale... 4, inhale.... 3, exhale.... 2, inhale.... 1
