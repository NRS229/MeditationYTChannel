Slowly close your eyes and visualize the energy flowing through your body, feel your muscles relaxing as you get into a more passive mental space.
Close your eyes and allow every worry, task and negative thought to float away. You have no time for them here, and so you let each of them go. Every bad thought, fear and worry. Watch them all float away on the great big ocean in your mind.
Turn your awareness to the ground beneath you. Firm. Strong. And if you feel comfortable doing so, slowly close your eyes...
Close your eyes and begin to take a journey through your body. Do a mental check of everything you feel. Make yourself aware of any pain. and any happiness... Any fear... And every hope. Acknowledge them and feel them.
Close your eyes and begin to focus on your breath... As you do, notice how your body moves with each inhale and exhale.
Close your eyes if you wish, or focus your gaze on one spot. Begin with your attention directed outward, noticing the sounds around you. Concentrate on all the things you can hear...
Let's begin by closing your eyes or focusing on one spot in the room.
Close your eyes, or focus your gaze on one spot in the room.
You may want to close your eyes, or focus your gaze on one spot in the room.
Close your eyes, and take a few moments to just breathe.
Close your eyes or focus your gaze on one small area.
Now be still and close your eyes.
