Notice your waist... your hips... legs... ankles... and feet...
Reaching the level of your hips...keep observing and moving your attention down. How does this part of your body feel? Notice any tension without trying to change anything... your knees... Keep scanning...all the way down to your feet.
Focus on your your waist area.... relax... hips... relax... upper legs...relax... knees... relax lower legs.... relax... ankles.... relax... feet... relax...
Relax your hips and pelvis, and all the surrounding muscles. Allow the relaxation to continue, relaxing your upper legs. Let the muscles of your legs completely let go...feeling very heavy and relaxed. Relax your knees... lower legs... ankles... and feet, allow a feeling of relaxation to fill your feet...feeling heavy, loose, and relaxed.
Feel the relaxation flowing.... allow your pelvic area to relax.... notice how your legs feel very heavy... feel your thighs relaxing and letting go.... Enjoy the feeling of relaxation as it continues to your knees... feel your lower legs... let the relaxation continue to your ankles. Feel how loose and relaxed your ankles feel.... your feet... wiggle your toes once or twice, and then allow your toes to be still and relaxed.
