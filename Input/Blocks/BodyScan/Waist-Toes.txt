Notice your waist... your hips... notice your legs... ankles... and feet...
Reaching the level of your hips...keep observing and moving your attention down. How does this part of your body feel? Notice any tension without trying to change anything... check your knees... Keep scanning...all the way down to your feet.
Focus on your your waist area.... relax your hips... relax your upper legs... knees... lower legs.... relax your ankles.... and feet...
Relax your hips... pelvis, and all the surrounding muscles. Allow the relaxation to continue to your upper legs. Let the muscles of your legs completely let go...feeling very heavy. Relax your knees... lower legs... ankles... and feet... feeling heavy, loose, and relaxed.
Allow your pelvic area to relax.... notice how your legs feel very heavy... feel your thighs relaxing and letting go.... Enjoy the feeling of relaxation as it continues to your knees... feel your lower legs... your ankles. Notice how loose and relaxed your ankles feel.... your feet... wiggle your toes once or twice, and then allow your toes to be still
