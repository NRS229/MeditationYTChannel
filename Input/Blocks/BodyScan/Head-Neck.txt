Check your head... and face. Observe your eyes, your nose... your mouth... keep moving downward to your neck... collarbone... and shoulders
Turn your attention to your head. Observe. Moving your attention downward, to the level of your eyes, nose... and chin...down to your shoulders. Noticing each area, observing how your body feels.
Notice your head... your face.... relax your neck ... relax your mouth... your jaw... let your shoulders loose and soft...
Relax your face... feel your head... you can move your head if you want to... Allow the muscles of your jaw to relax...letting go... also check your shoulder muscles... let go of any tension
Feel your head relaxing... the top of your head... your eyebrows... eyelids are very heavy... let your eyes relax... feel your nose... your tongue... feel the back of your head... unclench your jaw... and soften your neck muscles
Focus now on your face and jaw. Relax... tensing first if you want to. Let all the tension leave your face..... let the tension leave your jaw.... leaving your face and jaw limp, smooth, and relaxed.
Focus on your head... your eyes... nose... and mouth... allow your jaw to drop slightly, letting the muscles of your face and jaw become loose and relaxed...  Check your neck for any discomfort you may be experiencing
