Check your head... your neck... and face.
Turn your attention to your head. Observe. Moving your attention downward, to the level of your eyes, nose, chin...down to your shoulders. Noticing each area, observing how your body feels.
Notice your head.....relax... face.... relax neck ...relax.....
Relax your face... feel your head... Allow the muscles of your neck to relax...letting go...
Feel your head relaxing... the top of your head... your eyebrows... eyelids are very heavy... let your eyes relax... feel your nose... your tongue... feel the back of your head... unclench your jaw... and soften your neck muscles
Focus now on your face and jaw. Relax... tensing first if you want to. Let all the tension leave your face..... let the tension leave your jaw.... leaving your face and jaw limp, smooth, and relaxed. Check your neck for any discomfort you may be experiencing
Allow your jaw to drop slightly, letting the muscles of your face and jaw become loose and relaxed.
