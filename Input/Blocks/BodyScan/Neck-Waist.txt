Continue scanning your body, moving downward to your shoulders... arms... and hands. Mentally scan your sides, chest, back and stomach...
Nearing the center of your body, at the level of your chest... your stomach. How is this part of your body feeling? Check your sides... check your waist
Allow your body to relax. Feel your shoulders relaxing, the muscles releasing their hold. Feel the temperature of your chest... your arms and hands... feel your stomach... feel your waist...
Notice your upper back....relax this part... notice your chest ... your middle back .....relax your abdomen ..... relax your stomach..... check your lower back..... notice your shoulders... relax your upper arms and elbows..... relax your lower arms..... wrists ... and hands.
Relax your shoulders, feeling them lowering slightly...finding a comfortable, relaxed position...free from tension... Feel your chest, back, and sides...feeling very heavy. Feel your stomach and lower back relaxing...the muscles giving up their hold. Relax your elbows and upper arms...loose and heavy. Feel your lower arms letting go. Notice your hands.. all the way from your wrists to your fingertips.
Let the relaxation continue from your upper back.... middle back.... and lower back.... Your arms become completely limp and relaxed.... pleasant.... soft.... Notice your shoulders... your upper arms.... your elbows.... let the relaxation continue to your lower arms.... your wrists.... and your hands.... Now your abdomen..... feel the muscles becoming loose, letting go of all the tension.... allow your lower back to relax..... feel the relaxation there as the muscles give up their hold.... leaving nothing but relaxation... calm.... peaceful....feel your sides, abdomen, and chest gently moving in and out with each breath....
See if you can create a feeling of relaxation in your shoulders. You may choose to tighten the muscles, and then relax, or you can simply relax without tensing first. Do whatever seems to work the best.Starting with your hands and arms, first tighten your hands into fists. Feel the tension in your hands and arms. Hold.... tighter.... tighter.... and relax. Let go, allowing your arms to be relaxed, loose, and limp. Notice the difference between tension and relaxation.
Allow the muscles of your back to relax...from your neck...to your upper back...middle back...lower back...feeling your whole body relaxing.
Let your muscles become loose and relaxed, starting with your neck... shoulders.... arms.... hands.... then your torso... back.... and pelvis....
Let the muscles of your back relax.... your upper back..... middle back..... lower back..... allow your chest and stomach to relax as the breath escapes slowly... relax your lower arms..... wrists ... and hands.
